This application ws designed to allow users to register for free and watch videos hosted externally using YouTube, Vimeo or any other video host with imbed options.

Registrations are confirmed through auto generated emails and password recovery is automated through email as well.

Each video can be given a quiz to complete the lesson.  Lessons are grouped in to categories and badges awarded once a category is complete of all the videos and quizzes.

Quizzes are scored based on given correct answer but if quiz is submitted incomplete or with incorrect answers it simply shows the correct answer highlighted in green.
